🚔 Crime Hotspot Mapping & Predictive Policing Platform
📌 Overview

Our platform is designed to help police authorities analyze, predict, and prevent crime more effectively.
By combining data-driven insights from the CCDNS and real-time user reports, we enable law enforcement to visualize crime intensity zones, plan efficient patrols, and respond faster.

🧠 Problem Statement

Police departments often lack real-time insights into minor incidents such as harassment or abuse — incidents that usually go unreported. Existing databases like CCDNS are powerful but not publicly available and sometimes lack immediacy.

💡 Our Solution

We built an integrated platform that bridges the gap between citizens and police using technology and data intelligence.

👮‍♂️ Police Dashboard

Displays color-coded crime hotspot maps based on CCDNS and filtered citizen reports.

Features a predictive model that forecasts future crime intensity by area.

Generates patrol route maps for optimized deployment and quick response.

Private and secure, accessible only to authorized police personnel.

📱 Public App

Citizens can log in using facial recognition, ensuring one person = one verified account.

Users can anonymously post complaints about crimes or harassment.

Public users can view nearby incidents, increasing community awareness.

All data passes through multiple filters to remove false or spam reports before reaching the police dashboard.
